## Project Introduction

Our project focuses on implementing the Cooley-Tukey Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm in Rust, leveraging SIMD instructions and multithreading for improved performance. The Cooley-Tukey FFT is a widely used algorithm for efficiently computing the discrete Fourier transform of a sequence or its inverse. By integrating SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions and multithreading, we aim to maximize parallelism and exploit hardware-level optimizations for faster FFT computation.
